# the-code-cabinet

A curated collection of Python, SQL, and data science projects â€” from challenges to competitions â€” neatly organized in one place.

Welcome to my personal collection of coding projects, exercises, and data explorations. This repository is a curated space where I document and showcase my work across various platforms, including Kaggle, Stratascratch, Checkio, and Hackerrank.

ðŸ›  **Whatâ€™s inside:**
- Python & SQL challenges from interview prep platforms  
- Data science mini-projects and case studies  
- Algorithmic problem-solving and exploratory notebooks

Each section is organized by platform or topic, with clear explanations, clean code, and brief reflections on what Iâ€™ve learned.

This is an evolving space â€” I update it regularly as I grow in my journey as a data scientist.
